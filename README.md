Shows basic graphics for "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
Description of data: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available

===================================================================
The following are key variables of interest  taken from the UCI web site:
-Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
-Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
-Global active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
-Global reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
-Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
-Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
-Sub metering\\_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
-Sub metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
-Sub metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
